 * To get your output (Getting all your output), if ";" causes error, replace it by "&&"
 * g++ -o main main.cpp tay_nguyen_campaign.cpp -I . -std=c++11; ./main RunOutput

 * a and b is just an integer, TASK is ALL by default but if you get output from a to b, TASK will be obligated to have value
 * TASK's value might be one of the following:
 * TASK0 for Task 0's output (in folder named .../..._config/config...)
 * TASK1 for Task 1's output (in folder named .../..._gather_forces/gforces...)
 * TASK2_1 for Task 2_1's output (in folder named .../..._fake_target/ftarget...)
 * TASK2_2 for Task 2_2's output (in folder named .../..._true_target/ttarget...)
 * TASK3 for Task 3's output (in folder named .../..._logistic/logistic...)
 * TASK4 for Task 4's output (in folder named .../..._battlefield/battlefield...)
 * TASK5 for Task 5's output (in folder named .../..._supply/supply...)
